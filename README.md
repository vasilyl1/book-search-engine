# Google books API Search Engine

Google books API search engine application with GraphQL API built with Apollo Server using JWT token based authorization.


## Description

The application allows to search the books and save the searched books in the user favourites. The results of the search are saved to MongoDB database. The appliocation is built using client-server infrastructure. Client uses REACT, server based on Express. GraphQl middleware is used to handle the requests into the database using Apollo server with Mongoose for easier querying of MongoDB. For the databases with unstructured data, it may get really complicated on creating the queries because of possible complex data models. GraphQL is a very useful tool which allows to create queries and mutations and test it in the live environment before applying to the code which greatly reduces the time to market for the code itself.
